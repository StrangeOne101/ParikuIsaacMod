# Pariku, The Soul Embracer

This is a mod for [_The Binding of Isaac: Repentance_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/), written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using the [IsaacScript](https://isaacscript.github.io/) framework.

It adds a new character, Pariku, to the game. The character is based of the streamer, ParikuYumi, but stands as its own character within Isaac.

Lore wise, Pariku is the daughter of Lilith, and has deep control over souls. The more souls she controls, the stronger she becomes. In game, the more soul hearts you have, the stronger the character is. Losing these hearts, however, will make the stat buffs revert.
